Hey, I'm Michelle! :wave: :wave:

I'm a sophomore at MIT studying computer science + robotics and working on imitation learning for bimanual, mobile manipulation in the [Improbable AI Lab](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/) at MIT CSAIL.

Broadly, I'm interested in building systems that reason about and interact with their environment. Currently, I'm most excited by robotic manipulation and foundation models :robot:

Find my [resume](resume.pdf) here. I would love to get in touch at wangmj@mit.edu!
