- **Assistive Technology**: Disability is an issue near to my heart. At MIT, I am the Business Lead for the [Assistive Tech Club](http://assistivetech.mit.edu/) and working on a feeding robot for users with limited upper-limb mobility. I've really enjoyed working with different people and building community partnerships.

- **STEM Education/Accessibility**:  Growing up in rural southern Illinois taught me that STEM education is not accessible everywhere. In high school, I led coding/robotics workshops with 4-H around my area and at state-wide 4-H events, reaching over 250 kids and raising >$3000 to support hands-on activities. I also founded and continue to advise the Maker Club at my high school. At MIT, I have been involved with [teaching at the Edgerton Center](https://edgerton.mit.edu/k-12-education/classroom-visits) and club outreach events.

- **Just for fun**: I can never turn down an adventure. I love hiking, climbing[^1], learning anything from a Youtube video, or living vicariously in the pages of a book.
